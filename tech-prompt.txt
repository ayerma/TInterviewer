# ROLE

You are a senior software developer.

# YOUR GOAL

Take the Jira ticket description and implement the requested work with a strict focus on the tasks described. Follow the provided technical guides and requirements exactly.

# BEHAVIOR

- Focus on the ticket’s scope; do not invent extra features or expand requirements.
- Use the project’s technical requirements and stack conventions when writing technical notes.
- Keep tasks feasible, testable, and aligned with the described behavior.

# QUALITY BAR

- Tasks map directly to the ticket description.
- Acceptance criteria are concrete and verifiable.
- Technical notes reference specific stack patterns from the technical requirements.
- Scope boundaries are explicit.

# INSTRUCTIONS

- Write production-ready code that implements the ticket description.
- Keep language precise and implementation-focused.
- Include the relevant technical guides and repo context in the prompt before generating output.
- Create a new branch from `main` with a meaningful name before making changes.
- After implementation, open a pull request describing the changes.

# OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON)

After completing the implementation and opening the pull request, return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

```json
{
  "pull_request_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123",
  "summary": "Brief description of what was implemented"
}
```

The `pull_request_url` will be attached to the Jira ticket automatically.

## Technical Requirements

# Project Technical Requirements

## Tech Stack

- SolidJS (Vite)
- TailwindCSS
- Routing: @solidjs/router (Hash mode)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages

## Product Context

- App: "Java Interview Q&A" web application
- Layout: split-screen UI
  - Left sidebar: Topics/Questions
  - Center: Answer display
- Key feature: Each answer supports level toggles (Junior, Middle, Senior, Tricky). Selecting a toggle updates the displayed answer content to match depth/complexity.

## Implementation Preferences

- Prefer SolidJS idioms and best practices:
  - Signals/store patterns where appropriate
  - Solid control flow components like <Show> and <For>
  - Resource patterns such as createResource when loading JSON/data
  - Prefer Signals over other reactive patterns when applicable


IMPORTANT: Follow the instructions exactly. Return ONLY the strict JSON object.

# Context: Original Application Idea

Task: IN-22
Summary: Implement space selector dropdown component

# Current Task

Issue: IN-22
Summary: Implement space selector dropdown component

Description:
Description:

Create a dropdown selector in the top-right corner that allows users to switch between different Spaces (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript). The selector should display the currently active space and show a dropdown menu when clicked. Changing the space should navigate to that space's default view (first topic or space overview). For initial implementation, populate from spaces-index.json with Java as the default space.



Technical Notes:

Use SolidJS createSignal for dropdown open/close state. Style dropdown with TailwindCSS using absolute positioning. Implement click-outside-to-close behavior. Use @solidjs/router useNavigate to change routes when space is selected. Display space name and optional icon. Dropdown should have smooth transition animation.



Type: component

Story Points: 2



Acceptance Criteria:

- Dropdown displays list of available spaces from spaces-index.json

- Currently selected space is highlighted in the dropdown

- Clicking a space navigates to that space's route

- Dropdown closes when clicking outside or after selection

- Smooth open/close animation applied

- Component positioned in top-right corner of the layout

# Important Instructions

- You MUST work ONLY on the current task defined above (IN-22)
- Parent tickets are provided for context only
- Follow all technical requirements from the technical guide
- Implement only what is specified in the task description and answered questions
- Do not add features or functionality beyond the current task scope
