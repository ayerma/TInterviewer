    "middle": "The JVM is an abstract computing machine that provides a runtime environment for Java applications. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. It includes class loader, bytecode verifier, and execution engine with JIT compilation.",
    "senior": "The JVM is a specification-based implementation providing memory management, garbage collection, and execution optimization. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. It features multiple GC algorithms, stack-based architecture, and runtime optimizations through C1/C2 compilers.",
    "tricky": "Consider JVM warmup, tiered compilation, escape analysis, and intrinsics. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Discuss class data sharing, AppCDS, AOT compilation, and JVM tuning parameters like -XX flags."
