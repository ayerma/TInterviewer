    "junior": "The 'final' keyword in Java is a non-access modifier that can be applied to variables, methods, and classes to enforce immutability and prevent modification. When applied to a variable, 'final' makes it a constant that cannot be reassigned after initialization: `final int MAX_SIZE = 100;` - for instance variables, it must be initialized either at declaration or in the constructor.",

When applied to classes, 'final' prevents inheritance entirely, making the class non-extensible: `public final class ImmutableClass { }` - examples include String, Integer, and other wrapper classes. The 'final' keyword also enables the concept of \"effectively final\" variables introduced in Java 8, where local variables used in lambda expressions or anonymous inner classes must be final or never modified after initialization. Using 'final' liberally is considered a best practice as it communicates intent, enables compiler optimizations, ensures thread-safety for immutable objects, and prevents accidental modification. For method parameters, using 'final' can prevent reassignment within the method body: `public void process(final String input) { }`.",

Common patterns include final fields for dependency injection, final classes for utility classes (like Math or Collections), and final methods in template method patterns where the algorithm structure should remain fixed."
