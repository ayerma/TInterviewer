    "junior": "JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the runtime engine that executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence by abstracting hardware and OS details. It performs class loading, bytecode verification, interpretation/JIT compilation, memory management, and garbage collection.",
    "middle": "JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the runtime engine that executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence by abstracting hardware and OS details. It performs class loading, bytecode verification, interpretation/JIT compilation, memory management, and garbage collection. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that includes the JVM plus core libraries (java.lang, java.util, etc.) and supporting files needed to run Java applications, but it does not contain development tools. JDK (Java Development Kit) is the complete development package that includes the JRE plus development tools like javac (compiler), jar (archiver), javadoc (documentation generator), and debugging tools.",

JDK (Java Development Kit) is the complete development package that includes the JRE plus development tools like javac (compiler), jar (archiver), javadoc (documentation generator), and debugging tools. The hierarchy is: JDK contains JRE, which contains JVM. For end users running Java applications, only JRE is needed; developers writing and compiling Java code require the full JDK. When you write `javac HelloWorld.java`, you're using JDK tools to compile source to bytecode; when you run `java HelloWorld`, the JRE loads and the JVM executes the bytecode. Modern Java distributions (Java 11+) often bundle JDK and JRE together, and tools like jlink allow creating custom runtime images with only required modules.",
