  "answers": {
    "junior": "Java's popularity stems from several key features that address enterprise software development needs. Platform independence is achieved through the 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' (WORA) principle - Java code compiles to bytecode that runs on any platform with a JVM, eliminating platform-specific builds.",
    "middle": "Java's popularity stems from several key features that address enterprise software development needs. Platform independence is achieved through the 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' (WORA) principle - Java code compiles to bytecode that runs on any platform with a JVM, eliminating platform-specific builds. Java is fundamentally object-oriented, enforcing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through its class-based structure (e.g., `public class User { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } }`). The language provides automatic memory management through garbage collection, freeing developers from manual memory allocation/deallocation and reducing memory leaks. Built-in multithreading support allows concurrent execution with classes like Thread and Executors framework, making it ideal for scalable server applications.",

Built-in multithreading support allows concurrent execution with classes like Thread and Executors framework, making it ideal for scalable server applications. Java emphasizes robustness through strong type checking at compile-time and runtime, comprehensive exception handling (try-catch-finally), and elimination of pointers that cause memory corruption. Security features include bytecode verification, sandboxing through SecurityManager, and built-in cryptography APIs. The rich standard library (Java API) provides extensive functionality from collections (ArrayList, HashMap) to networking, I/O, and concurrency utilities without external dependencies.",

The rich standard library (Java API) provides extensive functionality from collections (ArrayList, HashMap) to networking, I/O, and concurrency utilities without external dependencies. Java's simplicity compared to C++ (no pointers, no operator overloading, automatic memory management) while maintaining C-like syntax makes it accessible yet powerful. The mature ecosystem includes powerful frameworks (Spring, Hibernate), build tools (Maven, Gradle), and extensive community support, making Java a reliable choice for enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale distributed systems."
