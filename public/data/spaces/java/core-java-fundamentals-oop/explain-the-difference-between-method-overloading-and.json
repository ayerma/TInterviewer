    "junior": "Method overloading and method overriding are two fundamental concepts in Java that serve different purposes in object-oriented programming. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (different number, type, or order of parameters), resolved at compile-time (static polymorphism).",
    "middle": "Method overloading and method overriding are two fundamental concepts in Java that serve different purposes in object-oriented programming. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (different number, type, or order of parameters), resolved at compile-time (static polymorphism). Example: `public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` and `public double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }` are overloaded methods. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class, with the same signature (name, parameters, and return type), resolved at runtime (dynamic polymorphism).",

Example: `class Parent { void display() { System.out.println(\"Parent\"); } }` and `class Child extends Parent { @Override void display() { System.out.println(\"Child\"); } }`. Key differences: overloading happens within the same class or inherited methods, while overriding requires inheritance; overloading changes the method signature, while overriding keeps it identical; overloading uses compile-time binding, while overriding uses runtime binding through the JVM's virtual method dispatch. Overriding requires the method in the subclass to have the same or more accessible visibility modifier (cannot reduce access), and the return type must be the same or a covariant type (subtype). The @Override annotation is recommended for overriding to catch errors at compile-time.",

Overloading is used for providing multiple ways to call a method with different inputs, while overriding is used to provide specific behavior in subclasses, enabling polymorphic behavior where a parent reference can call subclass implementations at runtime."
