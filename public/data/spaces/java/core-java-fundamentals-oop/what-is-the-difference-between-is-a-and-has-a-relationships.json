  "answers": {
    "junior": "The 'is-a' relationship represents inheritance, where a subclass extends or implements a parent class or interface, establishing a type hierarchy. For example, `class Dog extends Animal` demonstrates that a Dog 'is-a' Animal, inheriting its properties and behaviors.",
    "middle": "The 'is-a' relationship represents inheritance, where a subclass extends or implements a parent class or interface, establishing a type hierarchy. For example, `class Dog extends Animal` demonstrates that a Dog 'is-a' Animal, inheriting its properties and behaviors. The 'has-a' relationship represents composition or aggregation, where a class contains instances of other classes as member variables. For example, `class Car { private Engine engine; }` shows that a Car 'has-an' Engine as a component. The key difference is that 'is-a' creates a tight coupling through inheritance and enables polymorphism (`Animal animal = new Dog()`), while 'has-a' promotes loose coupling and flexibility through object composition.",

Inheritance should be used when there's a true subtype relationship and the Liskov Substitution Principle holds, whereas composition is preferred when you need code reuse without implying a type hierarchy. Modern design principles favor composition over inheritance ('favor composition over inheritance') because it provides better encapsulation, flexibility, and maintainability. A class can have only one parent class in Java (single inheritance) but can contain multiple objects through composition, making 'has-a' more flexible.",

For example, `class Employee { private Address address; private Department department; }` allows an Employee to have both an Address and Department without inheritance complexity. Common mistakes include overusing inheritance when composition would be more appropriate, leading to fragile base class problems and tight coupling. The 'is-a' test is simple: if you can naturally say 'X is a Y' (Dog is an Animal), use inheritance; if you say 'X has a Y' (Car has an Engine), use composition."
