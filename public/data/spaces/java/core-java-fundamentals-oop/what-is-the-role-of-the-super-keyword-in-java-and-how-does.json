    "junior": "The 'super' keyword in Java is a reference to the immediate parent class, used to access parent class members (fields, methods, constructors), while 'this' refers to the current instance of the class itself. 'super' is primarily used in three contexts: calling parent class constructors with super(args) which must be the first statement in a child constructor, accessing parent class methods that have been overridden using super.methodName(), and accessing parent class fields when shadowed by child class fields using super.fieldName.",

Constructor chaining example: public Child(String name) { super(name); this.childField = \"value\"; } where super() invokes the parent constructor before initializing child-specific fields. Both keywords cannot be used in static context since they refer to instance-level members. A common pattern is using super in overridden methods to extend rather than replace parent behavior: @Override public void process() { super.process(); additionalChildLogic(); }.",

Understanding when to use each is crucial for proper inheritance implementation and avoiding issues like infinite constructor loops or incorrect method resolution."
