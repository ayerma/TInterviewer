  "answers": {
    "junior": "The 'static' keyword in Java indicates that a member (variable, method, block, or nested class) belongs to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. Static members are loaded into memory once when the class is loaded by the JVM, making them shared across all instances and accessible without creating an object.",
    "middle": "The 'static' keyword in Java indicates that a member (variable, method, block, or nested class) belongs to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. Static members are loaded into memory once when the class is loaded by the JVM, making them shared across all instances and accessible without creating an object. Static variables are commonly used for constants (`public static final String APP_NAME = \"MyApp\";`) and shared state, though mutable static state should be avoided in multi-threaded environments. Static methods can be called directly using the class name (`Math.sqrt(16)` or `Collections.sort(list)`) and cannot access instance variables or methods directly since they don't have a 'this' reference.",

Static blocks execute once during class initialization and are useful for complex static variable initialization: `static { properties.load(inputStream); }`. Static nested classes are independent of the outer class instance and are often used for builder patterns or grouping related functionality. Key considerations: static members increase memory footprint for the lifetime of the application, static methods cannot be overridden (they can be hidden), and excessive use of static state can make code harder to test and maintain. Common patterns include utility classes with private constructors (`class StringUtils { private StringUtils() {} public static boolean isEmpty(String s) { return s == null || s.isEmpty(); } }`), singleton implementations, and factory methods.",

Static imports (`import static java.lang.Math.PI;`) allow using static members without class qualification but should be used sparingly to maintain code readability."
