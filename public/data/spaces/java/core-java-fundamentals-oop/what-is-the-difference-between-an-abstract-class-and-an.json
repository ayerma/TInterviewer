    "junior": "Abstract classes and interfaces are both mechanisms for achieving abstraction in Java, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. An abstract class can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation), instance variables with any access modifier, constructors, and can maintain state, while an interface (prior to Java 8) could only declare abstract methods and constants (public static final fields).",

Abstract classes use `abstract class Animal { abstract void makeSound(); }` and are extended with `class Dog extends Animal { void makeSound() { System.out.println(\"Bark\"); } }`, while interfaces use `interface Runnable { void run(); }` and are implemented with `class Task implements Runnable { public void run() { } }`. Abstract classes are ideal when you have a clear 'is-a' relationship with shared implementation and state among subclasses (e.g., Animal hierarchy), while interfaces define contracts and capabilities that unrelated classes can implement (e.g., Serializable, Comparable). Abstract class methods can have any access modifier (public, protected, private), but interface methods are implicitly public (except private methods in Java 9+). Java 9 introduced private methods in interfaces for code reuse within default methods, and Java 8 added static methods for utility functions.",

Java 9 introduced private methods in interfaces for code reuse within default methods, and Java 8 added static methods for utility functions. Key decision factor: use abstract classes when you need to share code and state among closely related classes, and use interfaces to define contracts, enable multiple inheritance, and when unrelated classes should share common behavior."
