    "junior": "The four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. **Encapsulation** is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to internal state through access modifiers; for example, `private String name; public String getName() { return name; }` hides the field and exposes it through a controlled getter method.",

These principles work together: encapsulation protects object integrity, inheritance establishes relationships, polymorphism enables flexible design, and abstraction reduces complexity. In production code, proper application of these principles leads to maintainable, testable, and extensible systems. A common pattern is using interfaces (abstraction) with multiple implementations (polymorphism) that encapsulate their internal state (encapsulation) while potentially extending common base classes (inheritance).",

A common pattern is using interfaces (abstraction) with multiple implementations (polymorphism) that encapsulate their internal state (encapsulation) while potentially extending common base classes (inheritance). For example, a payment system might define `PaymentProcessor` interface with implementations like `CreditCardProcessor extends BaseProcessor implements PaymentProcessor`, where each processor encapsulates payment gateway credentials and logic. Understanding these principles is crucial for applying design patterns like Strategy, Template Method, and Factory, which are foundational to enterprise Java development."
